          <b>Anovulation</b> (having a menstrual cycle with no egg) is actually
          a common occurrence, affecting 1 in 10 women*.
        </p><br/>
        <p>
          A sure way to confirm ovulation is a <b>rise in Progesterone</b> level
          after peak fertility. Progesterone also supports implantation and
          elevated levels of PdG during the 7-10 day window after ovulation
          correlates to higher chances of a successful pregnancy.
